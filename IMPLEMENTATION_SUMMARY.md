# Recorder App Implementation Summary

## Current State

The Recorder app is currently in a transitional state, with some initial code based on the Live Captions app but still needing significant implementation to match the design document. The app's core purpose is to record audio from AugmentOS smart glasses, save the audio alongside transcripts, and make these recordings accessible to users.

### Backend (TPA Server)

The current backend needs refactoring from the Live Captions code to implement:

1. **Audio Recording Functionality**:
   - Subscribe to AUDIO_CHUNK stream
   - Store and concatenate audio chunks
   - Create WAV files from the raw audio data

2. **Timer Management**:
   - Implement the TimerManager class as outlined in the design document
   - Display the timer in the AR view during recording

3. **Transcription Collection**:
   - Use the existing transcription handler, but modify to collect full transcripts
   - Add timestamp information to each transcription segment

4. **Email Delivery**:
   - Integrate with Resend API for email delivery
   - Attach audio recordings and include transcript text

5. **Session Management**:
   - Implement proper per-session resource tracking
   - Ensure clean session termination and resource cleanup

### Frontend (Webview)

We have created a new React-based webview interface that provides:

1. **Dashboard**:
   - Recording controls
   - Stats overview
   - Recent recordings list

2. **Recordings Library**:
   - List of all recordings
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Sort options

3. **Recording Detail**:
   - Audio player with waveform visualization
   - Transcript display with timestamps
   - Download and sharing options

4. **Settings**:
   - Recording preferences configuration
   - Device status monitoring
   - Email delivery options

## Next Steps

### Backend Implementation

1. **Core Components**:
   - Create the complete `AudioManager` class
   - Implement `TimerManager` for recording time tracking
   - Build `TranscriptionManager` for collecting and formatting transcripts
   - Develop `EmailService` for sending recordings

2. **Update TPA Config**:
   - Update the `tpa_config.json` with proper app name and settings:
     - Language selection
     - Email settings
     - Audio format options

3. **Session Handling**:
   - Implement `SessionManager` to track resources per session
   - Ensure proper cleanup on session termination

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - Create REST API endpoints for the webview to consume:
     - List recordings
     - Get recording details
     - Download recordings
     - Update settings

### Frontend Refinement

1. **API Integration**:
   - Create service classes to communicate with the backend API
   - Implement data fetching for recordings and settings

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Add WebSocket connection to get live recording status
   - Implement real-time timer updates during recording

3. **Audio Playback**:
   - Finalize audio player implementation with real audio files
   - Add waveform visualization using actual audio data

4. **Authentication**:
   - Implement proper authentication for API access
   - Add user-specific data handling

### Testing

1. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test recording flow from start to finish
   - Verify email delivery with attachments
   - Test transcription accuracy

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with long recordings
   - Test with various languages
   - Test with poor network conditions

3. **User Experience**:
   - Optimize UI for mobile and desktop
   - Add loading states and error handling

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete backend implementation of core components
2. **Week 2**: Implement API endpoints and connect with frontend
3. **Week 3**: Polish UI, add real-time features, and conduct testing
4. **Week 4**: Final integration testing, bug fixes, and deployment

## Conclusion

The Recorder app shows good progress with a planned architecture and webview interface. The next steps involve implementing the core backend functionality according to the design document and connecting it with the frontend through well-defined APIs. With proper implementation, this will be a valuable tool for AugmentOS users to capture, review, and share audio recordings from their smart glasses.

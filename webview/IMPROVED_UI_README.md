# Improved Voice Recorder UI

This document provides information about the new, improved UI for the Voice Recorder application.

## Overview

The improved UI features a modern, clean design with three primary screens:

1. **Recordings List View** - Main screen displaying all recordings
2. **Recording Screen** - Active recording interface with real-time transcript
3. **Playback Screen** - Audio playback with transcript display

## How to Access the Improved UI

There are several ways to access the improved UI:

1. **URL Parameter**: Append `?ui=improved` to the application URL
   ```
   http://localhost:8069/?ui=improved
   ```

2. **Toggle Button**: Use the UI toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between UI versions

3. **LocalStorage**: The application remembers your UI preference between sessions using localStorage

## Key Features

### Recordings List View

- Floating Action Button (FAB) to start new recordings

### Recording Screen

## Design Principles

The improved UI follows these key design principles:

1. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices while still working well on desktop
2. **High Contrast**: Dark theme with careful color usage for better readability
3. **Focused Interactions**: Clear, large touch targets for primary actions
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information is emphasized through size and position

## Implementation Details

The improved UI is implemented as a set of React components:

- `RecordingsListImproved.tsx` - Main list view component
- `RecordingImproved.tsx` - Active recording screen component  
- `PlaybackImproved.tsx` - Recording playback screen component

All improved UI components can be found in the `src/screens/` directory.

     - Fetching all recordings
     - Starting a new recording
     - Stopping a recording
     - Deleting a recording
     - Renaming a recording
     - Getting a download URL

   - Updates the UI in real time when changes occur

3. **useAudioPlayer**
   - Manages audio playback state
   - Provides controls for play/pause/seek

## API Integration

The frontend now directly connects to the backend API for:

1. Getting all recordings
2. Starting a new recording
3. Stopping a recording
4. Fetching a specific recording
5. Renaming a recording
6. Downloading a recording's audio file
7. Deleting a recording

## Real-time Updates

The app now subscribes to these server events:

1. **recording:update** - When a recording is created or updated
2. **recording:delete** - When a recording is deleted
3. **transcript:update** - When a transcript is updated in real-time
4. **recording:status** - When a recording's status changes

## Testing

To test the frontend integration:

1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Test the recording workflow:
   - Create a new recording
   - Observe the real-time transcript
   - Stop the recording
   - Play back the recording
   - Rename the recording
   - Delete the recording

## Known Limitations

1. Share functionality is not yet implemented
2. Volume control is visually present but not functional
3. Error handling could be improved with better user feedback
4. No offline mode or caching implemented yet

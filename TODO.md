- [x] Implement recordings API endpoints (GET, POST)
- [x] Create SSE endpoint for real-time events
- [x] Add authentication middleware

## Implementation Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (After Code Completion)
- [ ] Configure MongoDB database
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare R2 bucket for audio storage
- [ ] Create environment variables template
- [ ] Swap in-memory stores with MongoDB

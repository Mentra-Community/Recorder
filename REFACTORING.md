# Recorder App Refactoring

## Notes Feature Removal

In this refactoring, we have removed the notes feature from the server side of the application. The notes feature was part of an older version of the app but is no longer needed.

### Files Deleted
- `/src/api/notes.api.ts`: API endpoints for notes
- `/src/services/notes.service.ts`: Service layer for notes

### Files Modified
1. **Database Models**
   - Removed Note schema from `db.models.ts`
   - Removed NoteDocument interface

2. **Database Service**
   - Removed all note-related methods from `database.service.ts`
   - Removed note import and conversion functions

3. **Recordings API**
   - Removed `/:id/notes` endpoint from `recordings.api.ts`

4. **Recordings Service**
   - Removed `createNoteFromRecording` method from `recordings.service.ts`
   - Removed NoteI import

5. **In-Memory Store**
   - Removed notes collection and all note operations
   - Updated exports to only include recordings

### Files Left Unchanged
- `/src/types/notes.types.ts`: Left for potential frontend references

## MongoDB and R2 Integration

We have also integrated MongoDB for metadata storage and Cloudflare R2 for file storage.

### MongoDB Integration
- Created schemas and models for recordings
- Implemented database service with CRUD operations
- Added fallback to in-memory store when database is unavailable

### R2 Storage Integration
- Enhanced storage service to support Cloudflare R2
- Implemented dual storage (local filesystem + R2)
- Added configuration options via environment variables

### Recording Updates
- Added API endpoint for updating recordings (rename)
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Environment Configuration
- Added environment variables for MongoDB and R2 configuration
- Updated documentation with setup instructions
